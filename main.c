/* This is a test driver for new_string.c, a re-implementation of the c string library.
 * Authors: Jarrett Gorecki, Liam Seymour 
 *
 * This file should not be included in the final submission.
 *
 * READ-ME: 
 * 	Adding a new test case is mildly convoluted. In each test function,
 * 	there are 1 or 2 arrays of arguments, this is for arguments of different types,
 * 	if two arguments share a type then they can be included in one 2d array. 
 * 	If a case is added then the case count needs to be incremented.
