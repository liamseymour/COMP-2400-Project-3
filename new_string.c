Description: The new_strcpy() function copies the string pointed to by 
			 source, including the terminating null byte ('\0'), to the buffer
			 pointed to by  destination.
       		 
			 The  strings may not overlap, and the destination string 
			 destination must be large enough to receive the copy.

Parameters:  Source - String to be copied.
			 Destination - String to be copied into.

Returns: 	 The new-strcpy() function returns a pointer to the destination 
			 string destination.
